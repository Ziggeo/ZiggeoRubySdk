Ziggeo Ruby Server SDK
======================

Ziggeo API (http://ziggeo.com) allows you to integrate video recording and playback with only
two lines of code in your site, service or app. This is the Ruby Server SDK repository. It's open source,
so if you want to improve on it, feel free to add a pull request.

For Rails applications, you can simply install this repository as a gem.
